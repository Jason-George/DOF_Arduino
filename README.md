# DIRECTION OF ARRIVAL

The details to this project's DIY are given in this [instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/LeaderFollower-Using-Direction-of-Arrival/)

This Project has twwo rovers, one a leader that takes its own path and a separate rover that follows it.
The leader emits Ultrasound pings at a constant rate and the follower has three different Ultrasound receivers, placed at three different directions,
to pin the direction from the ultrasound pulse is coming from.

The MIT App Inventor is used to create a simple app, that allows us to control the Leader using Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE).
Both the project file and the apk are given.

Cheers.
